Process injection- inject shellcode into exes/processes
elastic.co/blog/ten-process-injection-techniques-technical-survey-common-and-trending-process
ten different techniques that malware uses to hide its activity in another process. In general, malware either directly injects its shellcode into another process or it forces another process to load its malicious library.
Learn to read/write shellcode first.
